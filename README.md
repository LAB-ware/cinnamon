# cinnamon

A unique sound ID with an inaudible frequency is used during live events listened to by the app to generate an NFT to unlock submarined content.

- With a single press, cinnamon is able to listen and record live audio feed for a continuous 3 seconds. After the recording ends, that audio chunk will be pinned to Pi√±ata and minted into an NFT. Once the user has ownership of the NFT the user will be eligible to unlock exclusive content via submarine.
